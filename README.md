This repo contains line follower arduino code/
ALgorithms I got to know about:
1. Bang-Bang Control:
   it is the simplest form of algorithm
2. Proportional (P) Control:
   it uses amount of deviation from center line to proportionally adjust motor speed
3. proportional integral control:
   adds integral term for the amount of error accumulated over a trial
